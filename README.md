# Connor

This compiler was supposed to be bundled into [GraphOS](https://github.com/not-msb/graphos).
This repo exists to enable people to try the langauge without having to deal with my os.
Be warned, this compiler generates raw assembly, so you won't be able to actually run anything.

Update:
I've  deprecated this repo after a long 3 months.
I've been working hard on a rewrite in Zig.
The new compiler can be found [here](https://github.com/not-msb/connor).
It uses Qbe as the backend.
